# What is RMarkdown?

--

Authoring framework for data science.

--

You can:
1. Write, save, and run code
2. Generate high-quality reports that can be shared with an audience

---
RMarkdown Interface
![](images/interface.png)

---
# What can I use RMarkdown for?

--
- Share your analyses and results with your lab in a variety of formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, Word)
- Build interactive applications (e.g., Shiny)
- Write journal articles
- Make slides for presentations (like this one!)
- Create websites or blogs
- and more!

---
# Why use RMarkdown?

--

- RMarkdown was designed for easier **reproducibility**. 

--

- Your code and narrative are in the same place, so collaborators can see what you did, why you did it, and how you obtained your results.

--

- RMarkdown is flexible and can support several languages (e.g., Python, C++, Java, etc.) and several output types, which makes collaboration easy.

--

You can alternate between text and code within the same document

```{r}
#you don't need to use hashtags for text (outside of a chunk)
```

---
### You can also visualize what your code will look like once it's knitted!

---
# RMarkdown Overview

--

Every RMarkdown document has the following:

![](images/rmarkdown-overview.png)

---

# YAML

![](images/yaml.png)
--
Stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

--

The very top of your RMarkdown

--

Where you add title, author, date, output options, etc. 

--

Specify how you want your knitted file to look (e.g., do you want a table of contents? do you want your code to be visible? etc.)

---

# Text

![](images/text.png)

---

## Text


.pull-left[
**Markdown**

```
Text with **some words in bold** 
and *some words in italics*

```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Output**

Text with **some words in bold** and *some words in italics*

]

---

## Headers

.pull-left[
**Markdown**

```

# First-Level Header

## Second-Level Header

### Third-Level Subheader

```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Output**

# First-Level Header

## Second-Level Header

### Third-Level Subheader

]

---

## Lists

.pull-left[
**Markdown**

```

- Bulleted list item
- Bulleted list item


1. Numbered list item
1. Numbered list item
```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Output**


- Bulleted list item #1
- Bulleted list item #2

1. Numbered list item #1
1. Numbered list item #2

]

---

## Inline Code
Surround code with back ticks and r. R replaces inline code with its results.

--

```{r}
#Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`
```

--

*becomes*

--

Two plus two equals `r 2 + 2`.

--

- This is great for writing papers!

---

# Code Chunk

They start with three backticks and {r} and end with three backticks. 

.pull-left[![](images/chunk.png)]

--

.pull-right[

]

## Insert a Code Chunk: Keyboard Shortcut


.pull-left[
![](images/windows-logo.png)

**Windows**

*control+alt+i*     


]

--
.pull-right[
![](images/apple-logo.png)

**Mac**

*command+option+i*
]                                           
                                               
---

## Chunk Options

**Other options** that we won't discuss today:

- **`warning`** (show any warnings that R throws)
- **`message`** (show any messages that R sends)
- **`fig.width`** (default figure width)
- **`fig.height`** (default figure height)
- **`echo`** (show the R code in the knitted report)
- and many more ...

---

## Setup Code Chunk

--

A special code chunk with the text `setup` right after the `r`. 

![](images/setup-code-chunk.png)

--

All chunk options can be set at the **global level** (in the setup code chunk) or at the **chunk level** (for individual chunks).

--

Options at the individual chunk level **override** global chunk options.

---
## Knitting (aka Export)

![](images/rmarkdown_knitting.gif)

Your RMarkdown won't knit if you have errors in your code. Knit early and often to identify errors!

---

## Writing Reproducible Code
*(adapted from Harvard WiP Crash Course in R by Kirsten Morehouse)*

--

### Reproducible = .small[When you send someone your code and data, they can 100% reproduce your results, without getting errors (or divergent results)]

---

- Make sure you are using the **most recent version of R** (sometimes packages are or aren't
compatible with different versions of R)

--

- Update your packages: `update.packages()`

--

- Load AND install packages: 
    - `if (!require("packagename")) {install.packages("packagename"); require("packagename")}` 

--
    

- DON'T include paths when you load data. Your path won't work for other people. Specify working directories instead. 

--

- Save any models you've run.

--

- Clear your environment and try running everything again. Bonus if you run your code on a new machine.

---
## Share your code
#### Info to include:
- README file 
     - What should users expect to see in your repo?
- Instructions for reproducing your results (make sure to include the R script and data names,
as well as the order in which the scripts shoudl be run)
- Data + Codebook 
- Analysis script (bonus points for data cleaning script, too!)
- Saved models

## Your Turn


1. Create a new RMarkdown file, setting the default output format as Word.

    - File > New File > R Markdown...

1. Save your RMarkdown file as report.Rmd.

1. Go into the YAML and change the title to “My 2022 Report.”

1. Change the output format to HTML by changing `output: word_document` to `output: html_document`.

1. Add the following first-level header: "Introduction"

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 3)`

---

class: inverse

## Your Turn

<ol start=6>
<li> Add this text (note the bold and italics) below the introduction header: "My name is (write your name here). I am the most **amazing** human being. You've *never* met someone like me. Please hire me!"    

<li> Add the following second-level header: "Reasons Why I am the Best"

<li> Add the following list of reasons:
    - Because I say so
    - Because it is true
    - Why would I lie?
<li> Create a chunk using a shortcut
<li> Calculate 2 + 2 and save the result as a variable called "my_var"
<li> Print "my_var" using print()
<li> Knit and reopen the report.html file

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)`
